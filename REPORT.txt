REPORT.txt

This project contains one main program with many components. The driver file
is Pairwise_Sequence_Alignment.py it should be able to parse the arguments correctly
and can identify if there are wrong or missing arguments. The files
GlobalAlignment.py, Semi_Global_Alignment.py,and Local_Alignment.py contain
there respective functions.

Description:
• can perform pairwise sequence alignment of two protein sequences , or two DNA sequences depending on the user's configuration of parameters.
• can perform global sequence alignment, semi-global sequence alignment, or local sequence alignment depending on the user's configuration.
• can choose the corresponding scoring matrix (dnaMatrix or BLOSUM45) file depending on if it is a protein sequence alignment or DNA sequence alignment.

Known issues:

- Semi-Global alignemnt functionality is limited for the scoring fucntion need to be updated properly

- Local alignment is non operational and should not be tested it will cause the program to exit.
